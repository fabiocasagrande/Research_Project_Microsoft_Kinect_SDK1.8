# Research Project Microsoft Kinect SDK v1.8
Component-based Research Project using Microsoft Kinect SDK v1.8

New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)

                                          NYIT Educational Avatar Project

This project is a component based application, which means that existing programs have been used and customized according to this project’s requirements. 
I based this project mainly on two programs available to download on Microsoft Windows SDK 1.8:

•	Control Basics

•	Avateering XNA 

To build an interactive menu I used the Control Basics application which is a basic example on how to create a custom menu. Regarding the gameplay, I used the Avateering XNA application which was an example that showed a user body tracked avatar. 
Therefore, after I had these two components, my sole focus was to code and customize these two applications in order to create the NYIT application. 


# Application Outcomes

                                          Application Splash Screen

When the user launches the application, the NYIT logo and the title “EDUCATIONAL AVATAR PROJECT” appear for a couple of seconds on screen before redirecting the user into the main menu.

                                                  Main Menu

The main menu is composed by three user selections. 
The selection is made by a hand gesture as the Kinect will detect all of the user’s movements. 
On the first row, we have the first selection in which the user can select the first avatar. 
On the second row, the user will select the second avatar. On the third row, the user will select the scenario in which the scene will take place. Finally the user, after making all the selections, will be taken directly to the playfield by pushing the play button.


                                                  Game Play

When all of the selections are made, the user can then push the play button which will redirect the user to the play field.
